/**
 * Index CSS for tinita-react
 *
 * This file is kept for organization but should NOT contain @import statements.
 * The build script (build-css.mjs) automatically bundles all CSS files into styles.css.
 *
 * DO NOT add @import statements here - they will break in production!
 * Instead, let the build script handle bundling automatically.
